<span class="letterine"><i>I</i></span>n 2024 I took part in the workshop ["Non-Newtonian Flows in Porous Media"](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5230/schedule) at the Banff International Research Station. My talk about "Instabilities in rectilinear flows and their link to viscoelastic turbulence with and without inertia" is available [here!](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5230/videos/watch/202407151203-Beneitez.html)
 
In 2020 During the Covid-19 crisis I tried to introduce Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics for kids who could not go to school due to the lockdown in many countries in an online lesson together with [Encounteredu](https://encounteredu.com). The video is available [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqlVgovDX3Y)
 
I am also enthusiastic about science communication and reading about maths and physics in general. It is always great checking [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org) and [FYFD](https://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com) among others. I am interested in open-source software and in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. A very flexible tool that I use in my research is the general purpose spectral solver [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org).
