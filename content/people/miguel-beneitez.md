I am current a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Manchester. I work on topics related to fluids, data science, and applied math. I was born in Madrid, Spain where I studied Mechanical Engineering with an specialization in Energy Technologies. I completed my PhD at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) working with [Prof. Dan Henningson](https://www.mech.kth.se/~henning/), [Prof. Philipp Schlatter](https://www.lstm.tf.fau.de/person/philipp-schlatter/) and [Dr. Yohann Duguet](https://perso.limsi.fr/duguet/). I worked as a postdoc at [DAMTP, University of Cambridge](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk) with [Prof. Rich Kerswell](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/rrk26/) and [Dr. Jacob Page](https://www.jacob-page.com), where I also was a Junior Research Fellow at [Christ's College, University of Cambridge](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk).
