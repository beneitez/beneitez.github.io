This has hapened recently:
- 19th January 2026. We are recruiting for a PhD student at the interface between ML and viscoelastic flows. More information [here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/data-driven-approaches-to-viscoelastic-flow-control/?p184706). Join us!
- 8th September 2025. [Mihnea Cazacu](/people/) joins as a PhD student with [Jack King](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/jack.king), [Claudio P. Fonte](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/claudio.fonte) and [Miguel Beneitez](/people/).

- 1st July 2025. Our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377025725000783) on the role of polymer diffusion in viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow is now published on the J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.

- 14th April 2025. [Miguel Beneitez](/people/) joined the University of Manchester as a Lecturer (Assist. Prof.) in Fluid Mechanics!

- 7th April 2025. Our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02354) on explainable deep learning coupled with deep reinforcement learning is now available on arXiv.

You can meet us @:
